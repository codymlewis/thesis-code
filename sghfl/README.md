## Abstract

With the recent rapid expansion of the smart grid infrastructure paving the way for greater integration of computer and network technologies within the power grid, a ripe opportunity has emerged in applying machine learning techniques. So in this work, we consider the application of a variant of distributed machine learning, federated learning, which enhances data privacy. In doing so, we design a framework, SGHFL, that is tuned to the typical smart grid architectures presented in the literature and the real-world. With this, we consider the issues of robustness against users which aim to derail the system internally, and we consider how to maintain fairness when dropout of users is expected to be common. We evaluate our algorithms and framework within four datasets/environments of progressively increasing practicality and compare to state-of-the-art techniques from the literature, where we show the downsides and benefits of each according to the setting.


## Running the Experiments

To run the experiments, change directory to the `src` folder and execute the two scripts with the `scripts` folder.
