# On the Security and Robustness of Federated Learning with Application to the Smart Grid Infrastructure

Source code repository for my thesis work. A link to the thesis itself will be here soon.

## Summary of my thesis work

## Running the code

To run the code, you can use nix (https://nixos.org) to replicate my environment, in which case you will want to enable nix flakes and simply run `nix develop` from the
root of this repository to install and open the environment. From there, each of the folders in this repository have scripts to run their respective experiments.

If you do not want to use nix, this can also be run by creating a Python virtual environment and installing the requirements from `requirements.txt`,
we recommend using Python 3.12 in this case.
