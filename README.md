# On the Security and Robustness of Federated Learning with Application to the Smart Grid Infrastructure

Source code repository for my thesis work. To run the code, first install and open the environment using the `nix-shell` command from https://nixos.org then each folder contains scripts
to run their respective experiments. If you do not want to use a nix shell, this can be run by creating a Python virtual environment and installing the requirements from `requirements.txt`,
we recommend using Python 3.12 in this case.
